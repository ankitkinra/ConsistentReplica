Test Case basic requirements as I perceive from client perspective
1) Should be able to post root articles without reading.
2) Then download these articles from the servers, either the same or different, depending on the consistency, and display the result, whether it got persisted or not
3) Should be able to connect to a different server to test the status of the articles posted and display that result as well
4) Reading the articles and posting random children and then checking the result

Divide the scenario in rounds which are variable, 
each scenario is executed sequentially and if need be we can persist the articles posted in each round
so that we can test and mark when we did see these articles 


Also include the timer in this application and so we can keep a timer based on three types of operation we carry out and 
display summary in the end

<xml>
<clientsToStart number=5/> // all clients will do the following rounds separately
<rounds>
<round name="firstRound">
<post root=1 sno=1/>
<readItems sno=2/>
<post root=5 child=5 sno=3/>
<readItems sno=4/>
<readItem id=5/>
</round>
</rounds>
</xml>
